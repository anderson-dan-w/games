quick thoughts:

    more fire = attracts more visitors
    less fire = fewer visitors, but lower morale?
    more interaction with visitors: fight, tell to leave, invite to stay
    managing of resources such as food and water
    - which would lead into *needing* them to work (optional at first)
    - nicer vs. meaner leadership (morale, progress, etc)

    developing language? developing writing?
    making outpost colonies to create an "empire"
    - then writing makes it easier to share newly-learned skills

    letting some work and some "play" - occasionally inventive play
    - e.g. letting kids play together might develop writing faster?

    not sure about rules/law, seems a bit complicated at first pass
    but maybe rules of thumb: 'what to do with a thief? kill or work'
    - then people may fear you, or not respect you, etc, work harder or mutiny

    letting (unmanned) outposts be caches for supplies
    - sometimes they get squatters who take, or who leave things
    - can try to protect it with traps and etc

    language development -> giving orders (less manual collection)
    outposts can be given orders, or delegated to lead
    - and they can be innovative... or rebellious

    maybe eventually itd be fun to make it multiplayer
    - eg develop more communication and then connect w other players?
